# tin-whistle-tablature
MuseScore plugin to add tablature / finger diagrams to a tin whistle staff in a score

### Introduction
This provides a plugin to automatically add fingering / tab diagrams to the
notes in scores for tin whistle. The plugin will adjust for tin whistles tuned
to D, C and Bb, according to the instrument defined for each staff. Note that
if the staff instrument is not a whistle then no tabs are applied, otherwise the
plugin will adjust the tab diagram position for the lowest note possible
(currently D, C or Bb).

Note that the plugin for MuseScore version 3 does not do this and assumes a tin
whistle tuned to D. This is due to some general issues with version 3 plugins,
so we expect to fix this in future.

### Installation
* If using MuseScore version 3 then download the
[plugin](https://github.com/jgadsden/tin-whistle-tablature/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.

* Alternatively if using the older version 2 then download this
[plugin](https://github.com/jgadsden/tin-whistle-tablature/archive/version2.zip).

* Install using the [instructions](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation)
in the MuseScore 3.x Handbook, which typically involves copying the QML file to
the local MuseScore Plugin directory. If you are using MuseScore version 2.x
then use this [handbook](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/plugins#installation) instead.

* Open MuseScore and navigate to
['Plugins' -> 'Plugin Manager'](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#enable-disable-plugins)
to enable the plugin. Tick the box against 'tin\_whistle\_tablature' and apply
with 'OK'.

* This plugin relies on a font being installed, which is not included in this
download but can be obtained from
[Blayne Chastain's site](https://www.blaynechastain.com/wp-content/uploads/TinWhistleTab.zip) .
To install the font it is usually just a case of double-clicking the downloaded
`.ttf` file and agreeing to the install process. If that does not work then on
linux systems try copying the TinWhistleTab.ttf font file to the
`/usr/share/fonts/truetype/` directory.

### Using the plugin
The tabs will be added to the highlighted bars if you have made a selection,
otherwise the whole score will have tabs added. Here is an example score before
applying the tabs:

When you wish to apply the tabs then navigate to 'Plugins' -> 'Tin Whistle' ->
'Add tablature'. Here is the score with the tabs now applied:

and the equivelent if using MuseScore 2 :

You can back out by navigating to 'Edit' -> 'Undo'.

Code repository: https://github.com/jgadsden/tin-whistle-tablature/

There are two branches for this plugin in the code repository: one for
MuseScore 2.x on a branch 'version2' and the other for Musecore 3.x on the
'master' branch.


### Here be Dragons
The version for MuseScore 2 will check that the staff is for a tin whistle and
adjust the tab diagram position for the lowest note possible. As of June'19 this
has not been possible for MuseScore 3 so the plugin just assumes that a whistle
tuned to D is used - this being the most common. 

Once the Instrument type is made available to version 3 plugins in version 3.2
then this can be fixed. The latest plug-in supports both the earlier default
selection of a D whistle if you are not running v3.2 of MuseScore.

### Having problems?
Note that this plugin relies on a font being installed, see the Installation
instructions.

The plugin will skip any staffs that are not for a Tin Whistle, so for example
if the staff is for the Irish Flute then it will not apply the tabs. This makes
sense as other instrument's fingering will be different.
